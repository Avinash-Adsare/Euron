## SQL Advanced

JOINS =>

Types of joins =

1. Inner join - matching records
inner join ke aage right table


2.Left join


3.Right join


4.Cross join



- Full outer join is not available in MySQL not directly available in it .


CTE => (Common Table Expression)
used for recursive queries and improving readability
help us to break down to complex sql queries into much simpler format.
it is temporary result set

with keyword is used to write

example - 

with customers as (
select first_name from raw_customers
)
select * from customers;


coalesce -> 

***

Window Functions ->

It is advanced topic.

A Window function is a special type of function that allows you to perform calculation across a set if rows within a result set.
window fun is generally give row level

syntax - 

<window function>() over (partition by column_name() 
				order by column_name)

1) Row_Number() - It is a window function that assigns a unique sequential number to each row within a position of result set.

2) Rank() - that assigns rank to each row within a partition based on given order. Skip the rank if same occurance


3) Dense Rank() - That assigns a ranking to rows within a partition based on given order.It will not skip the rank

4) LAG() function - In MySQL that allows you to access the previous rows value from the result set without using self-join. Fetch the previous record. 


***


SQL Stored Procedure :(set of queies)

stored procedure is similar to functions.

" A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements that are created and stored in DBMS, allowing multiple users and programs to share and reuse the product."

Advantages - reusability, parametrization , performance benefits , encapsulation


Syntax -

CREATE PROCEDURE TEST(parameter_list)
BEGIN
     statements;
END:


DELIMETER $$
$$


- default delimeter in MySQL is -> ;

DELIMETER $$ keyword to start stored procedure

CALL to calling the stored procedure


We can declare the variable 

syntax - 

DECLARE variable_name datatype(size) [DEFAULT default_value]



* how to assign a variable name?


SET variable name = value

Parameter in stored procedure has 3 modes - IN,Out,INOUT


IN - It is the default mode when adding on IN parameter in SP the calling program must pass an argument to SP

OUT -SP send a result
